Victor Flynn was a highly regarded research physician specialising in human metabolism and heart disease. Flynn was educated in Melbourne and while a research fellow at the Melbourne University Department of Physiology, established a blood analysis unit which was the fore-runner of the Howard Florey Institute. In 1950 he received a Nuffield Research Scholarship which took him to St Mary's Hospital Medical School in London where he remained until 1986. In 1969 he was made Britain's first ever professor of Human Metabolism. He was a pioneer in research into the adverse effects of anabolic steroids and oral contraceptive, and strongly believed in the importance of informing patients of the dangers. During his time at St Mary's Flynn established the Heart Disease and Diabetes Research Trust and the Atherosclerosis Research Trust. Throughout his career and after his retirement he personally contributed many millions of dollars to these and other medical research funds.
