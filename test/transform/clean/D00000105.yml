abstract: Banner made of white stiffened linen with painted red and blue lettering
    'Methodist Babies' &amp; Children's Home'. Used around 1929. Holes in top corners
    suggest it was pinned, perhaps to a table at a street stall; there is no evidence
    to show that it was ever hung or supported by all four corners.
